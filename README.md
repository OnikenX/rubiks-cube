# How to do the rubik's Cube

[How to Solve a Rubik's Cube | WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-R0KrXvWbc)


## Descriptions and Terms

Sides: 

- L - left side
- R - right side
- U - Up/Top side
- D - Down/Bottom side
- F - Front side
- B - Back side

Steps in the algorithm:
- The algorithms are described as turning the sides clockwise  and if using the ' it is to be turned counterclockwise


Pieces:

- Center:
```
ooo
oxo
ooo
```
- Sides:
```
oxo
xox
oxo
```
- Corners:
```
xox
ooo
xox
```

## Making the yellow cross

Algorithm: **F U R U' R' F'**

#### 1.
When we have the yellow in line like:
```
oxo
oxo
oxo
```

put then in this position and do the algorithm

#### 2.
when you have to corners and the center position them like this:
```
oxo
xxo
ooo
```
And do the algorithm.

## Making the yellow face complete

Algorithm: **R U R' U R U2 R'**

### 1. having 0 or 2 corners

in the left face you need to have an yellow sticker in this position:

```
oox
ooo
ooo
```
and then do the algorithm

### 2. having 1 corners

when you have one you will have something like an fish, put it like this:

```
oxo
xxx
xxo
```
and do the algorithm

## Fixing the last row

Algorithm: **L' U R U' L U2 R' U R U2 R'**

### 1. Pairs on top

if you have an pair in the top like this:

```
xox
xxx
xxx
```
---

## Last step, fixing the sides:

If you have the complete side, position it opposite to you and use one of these algorithms:
 - if you want to turn the sides clockwise turn them with: **F2 U R' L F2 L' R U F2**
 - if you want to turn the sides counterclockwise turn them with: **F2 U' R' L F2 L' R U' F2**

If you don't have one complete side do one of the steps above and try it follow the above.


## Getting somewhere

Algorithm: **L' U R U' L U R' R U R' U R U2 R'**

when you dont have nither of the last 2 you need to do the following:
